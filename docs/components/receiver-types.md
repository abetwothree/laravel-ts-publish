`AbeTwoThree\LaravelTsPublish\Ast\ReceiverClassResolver` answers one question for the AST engine: which
PHP class, or classes, does this expression hold? `ReceiverType` carries the answer. Nothing in dispatch
calls the resolver yet. The handlers that follow a method's return through any receiver build on it.

## What a receiver type is

A receiver type names PHP classes, never TypeScript types. The engine needs both. To type
`$this->source->label()`, it first has to know that `$this->source` holds `Workbench\App\Enums\Status`,
and only then can `LaravelTsPublish::methodOrDocblockReturnTypes()` reflect `label()` on that class and
turn its return into TypeScript. A TypeScript type string such as `StatusType` cannot be reflected, so the
class has to be tracked on its own.

`ReceiverType` holds four fields:

| Field | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `classes` | Every class the value may be an instance of, as a non-empty list. |
| `shortCircuits` | `true` once the chain has passed a `?->` step, so the whole expression can end as `null`. |
| `elementModel` | The model of an Eloquent collection, for example `Comment` for `$post->comments`. |
| `relatedModel` | The related model of a relation instance, for example `Comment` for `$post->comments()`. |

`models()` returns the classes that are Eloquent models.

## Receiver resolution

`ReceiverClassResolver::resolve()` dispatches on the node class. `ReceiverClassResolver`'s class docblock
carries the same rules in short form.

| Expression | Receiver |
| --- | --- |
| `$this->resource` | `$scope->modelClass ?? $scope->instanceOfWrappedClass` |
| `$this->resource->prop`, `$this->resource?->prop` | The model-member rules `$this->prop` uses on a model-backed subject. The subject-declared property rule never applies. |
| `$this->prop`, with `prop` declared on the subject below any `Illuminate\` ancestor | Its native class type, else its `@var` classes |
| `$this->prop` on a model-backed subject | `ModelAttributeResolver::resolveAttributeClass()`, else the relation: its morph targets or `resolveMorphToBound()`, `[EloquentCollection]` with `elementModel` for to-many, or the related model |
| `$var` | `varModelBindings`, then `varCollectionBindings` (a collection with `elementModel`), then `requestVarNames`, then `closureParamExprBindings` and `localVarBindings` resolved recursively under `resolvingLocalVars`. An unbound variable is `null`. |
| `<receiver>->prop`, `<receiver>?->prop` | For a model class, the attribute and relation rules above. For any other class, its declared property's class. |
| `$this->method()` | The subject's own method. When the subject is a `JsonResource` that does not declare it, the backing model's. |
| `<receiver>->relationMethod()` on a model where `resolveRelation()` knows the name | `ReceiverType([<return class>], relatedModel: <related model>)` |
| `<relation receiver>->getRelated()` | `ReceiverType::of($receiver->relatedModel)` |
| `$request->user()`, where the receiver class is a `Request` | `AuthUserResolver::model()`, when that model is not `null` |
| `<receiver>->method()`, `<receiver>?->method()` otherwise | `returnClasses()` for every receiver class. Any `null` makes the whole answer `null`. |
| `X::m()`, `self::`, `static::`, `parent::`, `$var::m()`, `$this->resource::m()` | The class, then `returnClasses()` |
| `new X(...)` | `X` |
| `resolve(X::class)`, `app(X::class)` | `X` |
| `now()`, `today()` | `Illuminate\Support\Carbon` |
| `collect(...)` | `Illuminate\Support\Collection` |
| A ternary, `?:`, or `??` | The union of the non-`null` arms. Any unresolved non-`null` arm makes the whole answer `null`. |

`$this->prop` and `$this->resource->prop` share one code path. A `JsonResource` forwards what it does not
declare to its model through `__get()` and `__call()`, so the two spellings are the same read at runtime.
The one asymmetry is deliberate: a property the resource declares itself answers only the `$this->prop`
spelling, because PHP reads a declared property before `__get()` runs, and `$this->resource->prop` always
reads the model.

`returnClasses(string $class, string $method)` reads the method's native return type first. A named class
is that class, with `static` and `self` mapped to `$class`. A union of classes and `null` is those classes.
Any builtin arm makes it `null`. A method with no native type falls back to its `@return` docblock. The
resolver splits the union, drops `null`, maps `$this`, `static` and `self` to `$class`, strips generic
arguments, and resolves each name against `LaravelTsPublish::methodDeclaringFileClass()`'s imports. Every
name must be a loadable class, interface, or enum.

A ternary and a `??` differ in how they treat `shortCircuits`. A full ternary keeps an arm's flag, since
`$flag ? $a?->b : $c` can still end as `null`. A `??` or `?:` replaces a `null` first arm with the second,
so the first arm's flag never reaches the result.

## Attribute classes and morphTo bounds

`ModelAttributeResolver::resolveAttributeClass()` answers only for an attribute that `ModelInspector`
lists. A name typed only by an `@property` tag has no class to return.

| Cast | Class |
| --- | --- |
| `attribute`, `accessor` | The getter closure's native return class, then the `Attribute<Get, Set>` docblock's `Get` class, then an old-style `getXAttribute()`'s native return class |
| `date`, `datetime`, `custom_datetime` | `Illuminate\Support\Carbon`, because `Model::asDateTime()` returns it through the `Date` facade by default |
| `immutable_date`, `immutable_datetime`, `immutable_custom_datetime` | `Carbon\CarbonImmutable` |
| `timestamp` | None. `Model::asTimestamp()` returns an integer. |
| A `CastsAttributes` class | Its `get()` native return class |
| A `Castable` class | The `get()` native return class of the caster that `castUsing()` returns |
| An enum | The enum |

`resolveMorphToBound()` reads the first argument of a `MorphTo<X, $this>` generic and returns `X` when it
is a single model class, abstract or `Model` included. Every other shape returns `Model::class`. The bound
exists only so a member can be reflected on it. The resolver never emits or imports it, which is why it
accepts the classes `morphToDocblockTargets()` rejects.

## What stays unresolved

The resolver returns `null` rather than a partial answer in these cases:

- An unbound variable. The ambient `closureRelationModelClass` is never used as a guess.
- A bare `$this`, which no rule above names.
- A method or property whose type has a builtin arm, such as `: string`, `: array`, or `UrlService|string`.
- A union where any arm cannot be resolved, such as `$this->author ?? $nobody`.
- A first-class callable such as `now(...)`, which holds a `Closure`.

A partial answer is refused because a handler reflects the next call on every class the receiver names.
If one arm of `User|<unknown>` is dropped, `->label()` is reflected on `User` alone. The published type
then claims more than the code guarantees, and nothing downstream can tell the missing arm existed.
